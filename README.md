 Healthcare Data Analysis: Patient Journey Mapping
Overview
Welcome to the Healthcare Data Analysis project! This initiative harnesses the power of electronic health records (EHR) data to delve into and understand patient journeys within a healthcare setting. The analysis places emphasis on critical aspects such as waiting time distributions, time series analysis of patient admissions, patient segmentation based on age and waiting time, and root cause analysis pertaining to bottleneck probabilities.

Objectives
1. Waiting Time Distribution:
Gain a comprehensive understanding of waiting time distributions to identify underlying trends and patterns in patient waiting periods. This insight is crucial for optimizing patient flow and improving overall healthcare service efficiency.

2. Time Series Analysis:
Explore and analyze the daily trends in patient admissions and discharges over time. This analysis provides a holistic view of healthcare service utilization, allowing for strategic planning and resource allocation based on temporal patterns.

3. Patient Segmentation:
Investigate the intricate relationship between patient age and waiting time, further segmented by gender. This segmentation provides valuable insights into the demographics of patients, aiding in personalized healthcare approaches and resource allocation.

4. Root Cause Analysis:
Conduct a detailed analysis of the impact of bottleneck probabilities on waiting times. This root cause analysis aims to provide a deeper understanding of the factors influencing patient delays, facilitating targeted interventions and process improvements.
