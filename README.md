Healthcare-Data-Analysis-Patient-Journey-Mapping

Overview
This project focuses on leveraging electronic health records (EHR) data to conduct a thorough analysis of the patient journey within a healthcare setting. By applying data-driven insights, the aim is to identify bottlenecks, waiting times, and areas for improvement, ultimately enhancing healthcare services and patient experience.

Key Features
Waiting Time Distribution:

Visualize the distribution of waiting times to understand the range and frequency of patient wait times.
Time Series Analysis:

Analyze daily patient admissions and discharges over time to identify trends and patterns in healthcare service utilization.
Patient Segmentation:

Explore the relationship between patient age and waiting time, segmented by gender, providing valuable insights into patient demographics.
Root Cause Analysis:

Investigate the impact of bottleneck probabilities on waiting times, enabling a deeper understanding of factors influencing patient delays.
